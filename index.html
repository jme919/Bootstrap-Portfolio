					<h1>About Me</h1>

					<img src="assets/images/jan_michael_headshot.jpg" class="img-responsive mypic" alt="Pic of Jan-Michael">
					<p>My name is Jan-Michael Edwards and I live in the beautiful city of Richmond, Va. I have been doing audio/video work for the last nine years and have really enjoyed it. Through my work I have gained knowledge on a wide range of electronics, control systems, security systems, and access control. It has also given me the chance to develop leadership skills while leading large projects for local clients and even clients from around the country.</p>

            		<p>In my free time I like to play guitar, learn about theoretical physics, snowboard in the winter, and paddle board in the summer. Living in Richmond gives me access to a wide range of activities including the James River, local events, the beach, and the mountains. I love to learn, and I am always striving to gain new knowledge and better myself. I've been learning coding for a few months and hope that I can learn the skills that will help me start a new career.</p>
